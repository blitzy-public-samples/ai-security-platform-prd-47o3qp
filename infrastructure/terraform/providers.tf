# This Terraform configuration specifies the providers required for managing the infrastructure resources.

# Requirement Addressed:
# - Integration Capabilities (Technical Specification/4.10 Integration Capabilities)
#   Ensure seamless integration with existing security tools and external systems through well-documented APIs
#   and support for custom integrations, enhancing the platform's interoperability and functionality.

# External Dependency:
# - AWS Provider (hashicorp/aws)
#   Version: >= 3.0.0  # Terraform provider for managing AWS resources.

# Internal Dependencies:
# - variables.tf (infrastructure/terraform/variables.tf)
#   Defines variables used across the Terraform configuration.
# - main.tf (infrastructure/terraform/main.tf)
#   Orchestrates the deployment of the entire infrastructure using various modules.

# Configures the AWS provider with the specified region for resource management.
provider "aws" {
  version = ">= 3.0.0"  # Ensures compatibility with the specified version of the AWS provider.

  region  = var.region  # Uses the 'region' variable defined in variables.tf to set the AWS region.
}

# The provider configuration above integrates with other Terraform modules to manage AWS resources,
# facilitating interoperability and fulfilling the integration requirements specified in the technical documentation.
