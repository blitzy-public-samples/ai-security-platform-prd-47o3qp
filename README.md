## Setup Instructions

This section guides you through the process of setting up the platform, including installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and deploying services using Docker and Terraform.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (version 3.8): Required for containerizing and running services.
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multi-container Docker applications.
- **Terraform** (version >= 3.0.0): For infrastructure provisioning on AWS.
- **AWS Account**: For deploying infrastructure components.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/security-orchestration-platform.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd security-orchestration-platform
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. Refer to `src/backend/authentication_service/config.py` and other service configuration files for required variables.

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Each backend service has its own `requirements.txt` file specifying Python dependencies:

   - `src/backend/authentication_service/requirements.txt`
   - `src/backend/authorization_service/requirements.txt`
   - `src/backend/incident_management_service/requirements.txt`
   - `src/backend/playbook_engine/requirements.txt`
   - `src/backend/ai_recommendation_engine/requirements.txt`
   - `src/backend/notification_service/requirements.txt`

   Install the dependencies for each service as needed.

   ```bash
   pip install -r src/backend/authentication_service/requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Deploy Docker Containers**

   Use Docker Compose to build and run the services.

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/docker
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

6. **Provision Infrastructure with Terraform**

   Navigate to the Terraform directory and initialize the Terraform workspace.

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   ```

   Review the execution plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   Apply the configuration to provision resources on AWS:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

<!-- 
The Setup Instructions utilize internal dependencies like `docker-compose.yml` and `main.tf`, as specified in the file dependencies. This addresses requirements in Technical Specification section 4.16 Maintainability and Support.

## Usage Guidelines

This section provides detailed instructions on how to interact with the platform.

### Accessing the User Interface

After setting up the platform, access the user interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### Managing Incidents

1. **Viewing Incidents**

   Access the Incident Management Interface to view all detected incidents. Use the search bar and filters to sort incidents by severity, status, or date.

2. **Analyzing Incidents**

   Select an incident to view detailed information, including descriptions, affected systems, and related playbooks.

3. **Responding to Incidents**

   Utilize AI-generated recommendations to determine the best course of action. Execute relevant playbooks directly from the incident detail page.

### Executing Playbooks

1. **Generating Playbooks**

   Use the Playbook Engine to create new playbooks. The AI system will generate playbooks based on the latest threat intelligence.

2. **Customizing Playbooks**

   Manually adjust playbooks as needed to fit organizational policies. All modifications are version-controlled and logged.

3. **Executing Playbooks**

   Execute playbooks through the platform, which integrates with your SOAR solution to automate response actions.

### Utilizing the AI Assistant

Interact with the AI Assistant via the chat interface to receive real-time guidance and recommendations.

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain language to get immediate assistance.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Receive suggestions based on the current incident context.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide feedback to improve the AI assistant's responses over time.
