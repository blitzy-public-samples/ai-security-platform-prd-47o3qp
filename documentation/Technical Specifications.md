## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The platform employs robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and perform actions within the system.

#### Authentication

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: All users must authenticate using MFA, combining something they know (password) with something they have (e.g., OTP via mobile device).
- **OAuth 2.0 and JWT**: Utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication across APIs.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Supports biometric methods such as fingerprint and facial recognition for enhanced security on compatible devices.

#### Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implements RBAC to assign permissions based on user roles, ensuring users have access only to the functionalities necessary for their role.
- **Granular Permissions**: Defines specific permissions for various actions, such as view, create, edit, and delete, ensuring fine-grained access control.
- **Dynamic Permission Adjustment**: Allows for real-time updates to user roles and permissions through the User and System Management interface.

#### Authorization Matrix

| **Role**            | **Permissions**                                                                                         |
