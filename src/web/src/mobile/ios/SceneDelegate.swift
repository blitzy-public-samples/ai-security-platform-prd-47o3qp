//
// SceneDelegate.swift
// Manages scene-based lifecycle events for the iOS application.
// Responsible for setting up the initial UI when a scene connects and handling transitions between foreground and background states.
//
// Requirements Addressed:
// - Mobile Interface Design (Technical Specification/4.9 Mobile Interface Design)
//   Ensures that users can access critical platform functionalities on-the-go through a responsive and optimized mobile layout.
//
// Dependencies:
// - Internal:
//   - ContentView (src/web/src/mobile/ios/SwiftUICode.swift): Defines the main content view for the SwiftUI application.
//   - AppDelegate (src/web/src/mobile/ios/AppDelegate.swift): Handles application lifecycle events and complements SceneDelegate in managing multiple windows and UI sessions.
// - External:
//   - UIKit (version: latest): Provides the necessary interfaces for managing the application's UI and lifecycle.
//   - SwiftUI (version: latest): Framework for building the user interface of the iOS application.
//

import UIKit // UIKit, version latest - Provides the necessary interfaces for managing the application's UI and lifecycle.
import SwiftUI // SwiftUI, version latest - Framework for building the user interface of the iOS application.

// The SceneDelegate class conforms to UIWindowSceneDelegate and manages scene-based lifecycle events.
// It is essential for setting up the initial UI and handling transitions between different scene states.
// Addresses requirement 'Mobile Interface Design' at Technical Specification/4.9 Mobile Interface Design.
class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    // Global variable 'window' of type UIWindow?
    // This property holds the window instance associated with the scene.
    var window: UIWindow?
    
    // Function: scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)
    // Description:
    //   Called when the scene is about to connect to the app. Sets up the initial UI for the scene.
    // Parameters:
    //   - scene (UIScene): The scene object associated with the window.
    //   - session (UISceneSession): The session object containing details about the scene.
    //   - connectionOptions (UIScene.ConnectionOptions): Additional options for configuring the scene's connection.
    // Returns: Void
    //
    // Steps:
    //   1. Check if the window property is nil.
    //   2. Create a new UIWindow using the scene's coordinate space.
    //   3. Set the root view controller to a UIHostingController with ContentView.
    //        - ContentView is defined in 'SwiftUICode.swift' and serves as the main content view.
    //   4. Make the window key and visible.
    //
    // Addresses requirement 'Mobile Interface Design' at Technical Specification/4.9 Mobile Interface Design.

    // Description:
    //   Called when the scene will move from an active state to an inactive state.
