// Importing external dependencies required for the application's UI and lifecycle management.
// UIKit provides the necessary interfaces for managing the application's UI and lifecycle.
// Version: latest
import UIKit  // UIKit version: latest

// SwiftUI framework is used for building the user interface of the iOS application.
// Version: latest
import SwiftUI  // SwiftUI version: latest

// AppDelegate class is responsible for handling application-level events and the initial setup of the iOS application.
// It works in conjunction with SceneDelegate to manage the app's lifecycle, especially during launch and termination.
// Addresses:
// - Requirement: "Mobile Interface Design"
//   Location: Technical Specification/4.9 Mobile Interface Design
//   Description: Ensures that users can access critical platform functionalities on-the-go through a responsive and optimized mobile layout.
// Dependencies:
// - Internal:
//   - SceneDelegate (src/web/src/mobile/ios/SceneDelegate.swift): Manages scene-based lifecycle events and complements the AppDelegate in handling multiple windows and UI sessions.
//   - ContentView (src/web/src/mobile/ios/SwiftUICode.swift): Defines the main content view for the SwiftUI application.
//   - Assets (src/web/src/mobile/ios/Assets.xcassets/Contents.json): Provides images and icons used in the application.

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    // The main window of the application.
    // Global variable 'window' of type UIWindow?.
    var window: UIWindow?

    // Called when the application has finished launching.
    // Sets up the initial state of the app.
    // Parameters:
    // - application: The singleton app object.
    // - launchOptions: A dictionary indicating the reason the app was launched (if any).
    // Returns: Bool indicating whether the application successfully handled the launch request.
    // Addresses:
    // - Function: application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)
    //   Description: Initializes necessary services or configurations during app launch.
    //   Steps:
    //     1. Initialize any necessary services or configurations.
    //     2. Set up the initial UI state, possibly using SceneDelegate.
    //   Technical Specification:
    //     - Requirement: Performance Optimization
    //     - Location: Technical Specification/4.12 Performance Optimization (TR-PO-012)
    //     - Description: Optimize system performance to ensure efficient operation under expected and peak load conditions.

        // Step 1: Initialize necessary services or configurations.
        // For example, setting up analytics, logging frameworks, or dependency injection containers.
        // This supports efficient operation during app launch as per TR-PO-012.

        // TODO: Add initialization code here.

        // Step 2: Return true to indicate successful launch.
        return true

    // Called when a new scene session is being created.
    // Configures and returns the scene configuration.
    // Parameters:
    // - application: The singleton app object.
    // - connectingSceneSession: The session object containing details about the scene's configuration.
    // - options: Additional information about the scene's connection.
    // Returns: UISceneConfiguration to use when creating the new scene.
    // Addresses:
    // - Function: application(_:configurationForConnecting:options:)
    //   Description: Configures new scene sessions for supporting multiple windows and UI sessions.
    //   Steps:
    //     1. Create and return a UISceneConfiguration with the name and delegate class.
    //   Technical Specification:
    //     - Requirement: Mobile Interface Design
    //     - Location: Technical Specification/4.9 Mobile Interface Design
    //     - Description: Support responsive and optimized mobile layout for on-the-go functionalities.
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, configurationForConnecting connectingSceneSession: UISceneSession, options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) -> UISceneConfiguration {

        // Step 1: Create and return a UISceneConfiguration with the specified name and delegate class.
        let configuration = UISceneConfiguration(name: "Default Configuration", sessionRole: connectingSceneSession.role)

    // Called when the user discards a scene session.
    // Used to release any resources specific to the discarded scenes.
    // Parameters:
    // - application: The singleton app object.
    // - sceneSessions: Set of UISceneSession objects that were discarded.
    // Returns: Void
    // Addresses:
    // - Function: application(_:didDiscardSceneSessions:)
    //   Description: Handles the release of resources specific to discarded scenes.
    //   Steps:
    //     1. Release any resources associated with the discarded scenes.
    //   Technical Specification:
    //     - Requirement: Performance Optimization
    //     - Location: Technical Specification/4.12 Performance Optimization (TR-PO-012)
    //     - Description: Efficiently manage resources to maintain system performance.

        // Step 1: Release any resources specific to the discarded scenes as they will not return.
        // This is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance as per TR-PO-012.

        // Since we are not maintaining any specific resources for each scene, no action is needed here.
        // If resources were allocated, they should be released here.
