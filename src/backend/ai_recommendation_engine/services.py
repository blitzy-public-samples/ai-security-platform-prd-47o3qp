    Generates a list of recommended items for a given user based on their interaction data.

    Args:
        recommendation_data (RecommendationData): An instance containing user interaction data.

    Returns:
        list: A list of recommended item IDs.

    Steps:
        1. Load the pre-trained model using the path provided by get_model_path.
