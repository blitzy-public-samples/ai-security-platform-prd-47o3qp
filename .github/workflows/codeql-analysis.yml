# GitHub Actions workflow configuration for automating CodeQL analysis on the codebase.
# This workflow ensures that code quality and security vulnerabilities are detected early.
# Requirements Addressed:
# - Security and Compliance (Technical Specification/4.13 Security and Compliance):
#   Ensure the platform is secure against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats through robust authentication, authorization, encryption, and compliance with relevant regulations.
